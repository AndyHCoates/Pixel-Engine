# Pixel-Engine
A simple game engine for C# using DirectX. Inspired by the olcPixelGameEngine.

Check out the olcPixelGameEngine for C++ at https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine, and its creator, Javidx9 at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA.

This game engine was ported from C++ to C# in the hopes that it will help people develop their ideas faster and not waste their time in creating the same graphics code and game loop again and again.

This engine uses DirectX and the .NET Framework, so it is not very portable, but it's quite fast due to DirectX being hardware accelerated.

Please check the Licenses file included in the git for the original OLC-3 licence from the olcPixelGameEngine - https://github.com/DevChrome/Pixel-Engine/blob/master/Licences.

A step by step guide to use it can be found on the wiki page - https://github.com/DevChrome/Pixel-Engine/wiki.
